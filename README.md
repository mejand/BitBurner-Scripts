# BitBurner-Scripts
A collection of BitBurner Scripts.
## Structure
The scripts are divided by category. Since BitBurner does not always seem to handle folders and relative paths well the category is indicated by the first letters of the script name:
- bots: Bot scripts carry out a single action (hack, grow or weaken).
- ctrl: Controller scripts start bot scripts.
- stck: Stock scripts deal with the stock market.
- sup: Support scripts provide information for other scripts or perform other actions, such as starting controller scripts or gaining root access to servers.
- util: Utility scripts provide classes and functions for use in other scripts. They are not designed to be run by themselves.
